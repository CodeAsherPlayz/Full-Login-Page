### Instructions Before Downloading Software

1. When downloading this software, please ensure that you have a text-editor installed in your computer.

2. After downloading this software, please look through the entire code. For those that have a [] bracket, you will have to change it to fit you personally. This process should take about 5 minutes at most.

3. Please refrain from using the software from v0.2. and earlier due to a critical issue (issue #6) on an CSS styling error.

4. Enjoy the code.

*** 

### Advisory

1. Please note that this software should NEVER be used by businesses or companies. 

2. This is due to the password being exposed in the login_page_site_v1.0.js file or later.

3. Businesses and Companies can use this software only when a future patch has been rolled out to encrypt the password and username.
